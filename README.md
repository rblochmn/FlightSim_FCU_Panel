These files were all designed to be printed with a dual extractor printer, the text items are all separate files.  As long as you are using a supported slicer, they should all line up when you import them.

If you would like to modify the design or combine sections for a larger printer, the Fusion360 export file is included.

There are 4 main components to print that are split into sections for printing on a smaller bed printer:
    Front (3 sections)
    Back (2 sections)
    Circuit Mount
    Cable Management
